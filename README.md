Recipe website

## Description

This project shows and reflects on what I've learned in the last couple lessons of "The Odin Project". It's a simple recipe website which gives you a recipe for three different dishes.

To be able to create this project, I had to learn about:

- Headings
```<h1></h1>```

- Paragraphs
```<p></p>```

- Links
```<a href=""></a>```

- Images:
```<img src="" alt="" width="" height="">```

- Lists:
```<ul><li></li></ul>```

- Git & Github:
```git commit -m "This is a very good commit message"```

- General CSS:
```p {color: blue;}```

- Box model:
```div {margin: 5px;}```
